                     'a big deal. But you may still be wondering exactly "What '
                     'is OSGi "    Simply put, OSGi is a technology that '
                     'allows you to create highly modular Java applications. '
                     'It introduces a logical and physical module format, '
                     'called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your '
                     'application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi '
                     'lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall '
                     'modules at execution time without taking down your '
                     'entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local '
                     'service-oriented approach for creating applications out '
                     'of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of '
                     'modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi '
                     'is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with '
                     'such approaches and greatly simplifies their creation '
